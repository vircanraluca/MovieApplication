Movie Display Application

This application, designed with Vuetify, allows users to discover and interact with a variety of movies. The app seamlessly communicates with a REST API server, which in turn interfaces with a Firestore database. Below are the key features of the application:

- User Authentication:

Users can register and log in through Firebase Authentication, ensuring a secure and personalized experience.

- Favorites Management:

Users can add movies to their favorites list for easy access.
The app allows users to remove movies from their favorites list as well.

- Commenting System:

Users can add comments to movies to share their thoughts and reviews.
Comments can be deleted or edited by the users who posted them, providing flexibility and control over their content.

- CRUD Operations:

The application supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for movies and comments.
All CRUD operations are secured through a middleware layer, ensuring that only authorized users can perform these actions.
This robust and interactive platform ensures a secure and engaging user experience, making it easy to explore, review, and manage movies.
